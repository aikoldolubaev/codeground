# Searching patterns

## DFS (Depth First Search)
Uses a `stack` → last in, first out (LIFO).
- pop() takes from the end.
So you go deep before going sideways.
- Example: [a, b, c].pop() → c ✅



## BFS (Breadth First Search)
Uses a `queue` → first in, first out (FIFO).
- shift() takes from the front.
So you go wide level by level.
- Example: [a, b, c].shift() → a ✅
